# About Me

I am currently a MS candidate and employed as a research assistant in the Industrial Engineering department at Boğaziçi University, Turkey. I received my BS degree in the Mathematics department at Boğaziçi University as well. My main research areas are time series data analysis, feature extraction and machine learning. My thesis objective is finding an efficient feature extaction method on Numerical Weather Prediction models for wind power forecasting by adapting Histogram of Oriented Gradients which is a feature transformation technique. In this page, you will find some of my work for the assignments in my master’s courses and the detailed information on my teaching responsibilities. Feel free to contact me if you are interested in any further information.
